Enemy AI Outline:

Carrier:


	-Fly in a circle at a fixed distance around the center point of game space
	-throw flak cannon at repeated intervals

	

Fighter:

if(distance btween fighter and player is less than [accaptable distance]){
	apply thrust towards player

	//maybe variable based on the distance bertween the player and the fighter() greater distance = more thrust applied towards
	
	
}

	look toward the player
	fire laser at player




Sniper?:

if(distance between ship and player is less than [risk value] and not charging laser){
	teleport behind player at distance riskvalue*2
	
	Ogre::Quaternion turnandface = player_camera->getOrientation // get direction so we can set the turret to face the player right away
	Ogre::Vector 3 position = camera_first_person_node-> getPosition() -  riskvalue*2;

	-show fancy explostion at current position and at new position for x amount of time
	-shipposition = new position
	-shiporentation = turnandface;
	



}

if(distance between ship and player is greater than [risk value]){

	turn slightly towards the players position
//EXAMPLE
/*
	Ogre::Vector3 enemyPos = m_fightEnemy->getSceneNode()->getPosition();
	Ogre::Vector3 playerPos = m_player->getSceneNode()->getPosition();

	Ogre::Vector3 lookDir = enemyPos;
	lookDir.y = playerPos.y;
   
	m_player->getSceneNode()->lookAt(lookDir, Ogre::Node::TransformSpace::TS_WORLD);
	m_player->getSceneNode()->yaw(Ogre::Degree(180));
*/

	increase chargeInt
		if(chargInt >  maxCharge){
			stay put for one second (no rotating to face the player)
			fire laser
			chargInt = 0;
		}
